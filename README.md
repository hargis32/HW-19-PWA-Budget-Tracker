# HW-19-PWA-Budget-Tracker

## Description

This app was built to give the user the ability to track their budget, either online or offline. When offline, the user can still input deposits or deductions from their budget, and have the data stored via indexedDB. When the app comes back online, the data is passed into permanent storage. This app was built using Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose Schema, Node.js, and IndexedDB.
